## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

- added further examples to the .Rd files
- changed the way the option for mc.warning is set and restored by using the on.exit() function
- changed order of the y axis for plot_grid

## R CMD Checks

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There was two NOTEs: 

* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
Maintainer: 'Moritz Schwarz <moritz.schwarz@scmo.eu>'

This is expected as this is the first submission of this package.

*Possibly misspelled words in DESCRIPTION:
     Pretis (15:292)
     Schwarz (15:303)
     operationalising (15:224)
     
The first two are names of the authors. Both are correct. The final one was confirmed to be correct using the Oxford Dictionary and using British English.
