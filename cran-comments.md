## Submission
This is a minor update to fix a few bugs. This should rectify the issues associated with the CRAN archival. 

- I fixed a small error in geom_tile() that I think was the reason for CRAN archival
- I have fixed a bug in isatpanel() that produced false results when using 'AR' other than 0
- I fixed a bug in break_uncertainty() and added a new test file for it
- I added a small option to plot_grid()


## R CMD Checks

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.
